WordPress Recent Comments Widget, Enhanced
==========================================

This widget displays the recent comments from your blog, without the ones from the admins.
It is simply based on the regular recent comments widget, provided with any WordPress install.

To use it, simply include widget.php in your functions.php file, or paste the class sourcecode directly in it.
